       <p> Many people have described the very early era of social media to be culturally different based on what platform they primarily used. MySpace was created in 2003 with Facebook following closely after in 2004. Both platforms were initially created for people to connect with each other more easily as the world was moving towards a digital age. While they both had many similarities, there were some key features that distinguished the two. MySpace became an area of creativity as the platform encouraged its users to freely express themselves through personal stylization of their own pages. There was also an outstanding difference between target audiences and users. This distinct feature and its differing demographic was the root cause of the cultural difference between the two social media platforms.

    <p>In Kate Wagner's "404 Page Not Found", the author explains that the culture of MySpace and Facebook was established from the websites' younger users. The age of these users ranged from 12-14, meaning that they were tweens in middle school to early high school. Some of the tweens pretty much came to the same consensus as stated, "One white teen, for instance, called Myspace a "ghetto," and another described Facebook as "the place where the 'honors kids' got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay" (Wagner). The choice of words described from the interviewed tween such as  "ghetto" and "honor kids" were intentional and can be explained through a multitude of reasons.
</p>
    
    <p> One reason comes from the racial demographics of both social media platforms, which is probably the most evident explanation. The creator of Facebook, Mark Zuckerburg, made the platform with the intention of fellow Harvard students using it. The reported demographic was said to be a reflection of the student body of Harvard. That being said, it completely explains why the demographic of the app was predominantly white during its public launch. MySpace also had reports of there being primarily white users, however many people of color still preferred it over Facebook. 
</p>
    
    <p>Beside the users, the overall aesthetic of the platforms also pushed the narrative that many tweens believed in. Wagner states, "Parents, who were often spurred by the moral panics (often racialized) surrounding inappropriate social media use on the anarchic Myspace, began to view Facebook as a cleaner, less seedy alternative for their children" (Wagner). Like stated before, MySpace creator, Tom Anderson, wanted his users to take advantage of the creative aspect of the platform in order to fully express themselves. He gave his users the ability to customize their own profile and share other mediums of art, which was often music. Many along with Wagner believe that creativity died when others used Facebook instead. "In choosing Facebook, these users not only relinquished the creative flexibility of Myspace, they also, we now know, forfeited their privacy," (Wagner). Facebook had a very simple and minimalistic look. It had a white background with pops of blue, and everything was constrained within thin blue boxes. Users could only express themselves with their profile picture.

        Wagner argues that MySpace is truly a unique platform that has not and could not be replicated. The care and the intricacies that were placed into the web design would be cherished by all previous users as Wagner explains, "These dying artifacts of Web 1.0 still offer us a priceless view of what individual and collective agency once meant on the web. Looking back at them, I'm astonished at the richness of their content, the strangeness that makes them equal to their iconic '90s predecessors," (Wagner). Many can agree that social media platforms nowadays are just copies of each other down to user experience and layout. Now with the creation of AI and the implementation of it on several modern day platforms, it truly comes to no surprise that individualism and originality has slowly come to an end.
