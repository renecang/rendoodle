        <p> Love love love going to Fairy Tail every single night! I have never felt so at home with Lucy and Natsu. I am so happy that I came across this page. I hope to shift to other worlds every week. Happy Shifting everyone!</p>
            
            <p id="woah"> Izzy has informed me that she has lost her journal and has not been able to shift anywhere for the last few months. Unfortunately she has been removed from the shifting community because she has not been able to purchase a new journal, therefore she can no longer shift ever. She is deeply distraught over this and would like some space from everyone. </p>

    <p> I met all my favorite characters like Fred and George in Hogwarts last night! I even got into the house that I wanted, which is Ravenclaw. It was super cool getting to walk around Hogsmeade and try butterbeer. Buying the journal really helped a lot! </p>
    
    <p> <strong> Wendy R. </strong></p>
        <p>I've been visting Haikyuu a lot recently. I made sure to put that I'm the manager of the Nekoma team in my journal. I can't wait to meet everyone else at Karasuno tonight!</p>
    <p><strong> Jasmine K.</strong></p>
      <p> Shifting to The Walking Dead is not for the faint of heart! Highly recommend writing yourself as being immune to walkers and to never feeling hungry. I'll probably pick a different world tomorrow night. Maybe Ouran High School Host Club for a change of pace lol. </p>

      <p> Ever since I bought Luna's pen, my shifts have been a lot smoother. I've been to Fairy Tail and One Piece so far. </p>
                <p><strong> Bonnie O.</strong></p>
      <p> I have been shifting to MHA every other night so far and it has been so cool! I try to shift even when I nap, but I haven't had success yet. Anyways, I really love how insightful Luna has been about how to shift. </p>
                <p><strong> Ottie I.</strong></p>
      <p> I love shifting to Demon Slayer! I made myself one of hashiras and it has been so amazing! I don't like going on all the missions, so I just stay at the Butterfly Mansion most of the time. </p>
              <p><strong> Tara M.</strong></p>
      <p> I am so grateful that I found Starwhisper Journals! I have been able to shift to the Doctor Who universe everyday. I think I will write myself to be one of the doctors next week. </p>
            <p><strong> Penny H.</strong></p>
      <p> I shifted to the Isle of Berk last night! It was soooo cool! It was a little scary riding on top of the dragons, but I had Astrid with me the whole time and she helped me calm down. I can't wait to fall asleep again! </p>
            <p><strong> Zeke W.</strong></p>
      <p> I was a little skeptical at first, but shifting is actually real. I tried it last night and I was able to go to the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. I will definetly buy Luna's journal and pen so that the connection is even stronger. </p>
            <p><strong> Quinn D.</strong></p>
      <p> I saw someone else post that they shifted to Haikyuu and I just want to say that they need to back off. I shifted there first and I do not want to run into them. They probably don't even play volleyball. Love Luna though, her pen is super legit.</p>
            <p><strong> Cathy E.</strong></p>
      <p> I shifted to the MCU last week and was able to meet Spiderman. I really love shifting and Luna! Can't wait for my next shift!</p>
