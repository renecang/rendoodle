          <p> <strong> 07/01 </strong></p>
<p>Today was my first successful attempt at shifting to BNHA. I haven’t met everyone yet, but I did bump into Midoriya! I really want to meet Todoroki though. My shift was too short :( </p>
            
          <p> <strong>07/02</strong></p>    
    <p>I worked on my template more today before I shifted! I finally picked my quirk too. I get to control people’s emotions! It didn’t work that well when I tried it today though ಥ_ಥ.</p>

<p> <strong>07/04 </strong></p>
<p>I met Todoroki!! I put in my journal that we were childhood best friends, so it wasn’t awkward at all. He was also really impressed with my quirk! I’m also the top of the class and I beat Bakugo at the school festival!</p>
    
<p> <strong>07/05 </strong></p>
<p>God, Bakugo is so rude! I want to write him out of my world so bad, but he’s my moot’s fav so I can’t. Momo has also been getting on my nerves. I really need to think about my prompts tomorrow.</p>
    
<p> <strong>07/10 </strong></p>
<p>I got rid of him. I couldn’t stand that idiot in my world any longer. I don’t really care that Lizzy isn’t talking to me anymore. It’s my world anyways, if she likes him that much then she SHIFT herself. If Momo keeps being annoying, she’s next.</p>
    
<p> <strong>07/15 </strong></p>
<p>Todoroki and I got rid of the League of Villains. Now it can just be us heroes everywhere.</p>
